# hwmonitor

> A minimalist, high-performance hardware discovery engine for Linux systems.

**hwmonitor** is a lightweight, low-dependency (C11) command-line utility designed for developers and system administrators who require structured, low-latency hardware telemetry. Rather than relying on expensive external shell calls (`lspci`, `dmidecode`, or `lshw`), **hwmonitor** interfaces directly with the Linux kernel via `/sys` and `/proc` filesystems.

It provides both beautiful, human-readable terminal output and highly structured JSON for modern monitoring stacks and API integrations.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Native Performance:** Written in pure C. Direct kernel filesystem parsing ensures near-instant execution times.
* **🕒 Live Watch Mode:** Real-time hardware monitoring with sub-second refreshes using `--watch`.
* **🤖 AI Hardware Consultant:** Built-in integration with the Groq API allows you to ask natural language questions about your hardware (e.g., bottlenecks, linux driver compatibility) directly from the terminal.
* **JSON-First Architecture:** Built-in serialization for seamless integration into dashboards, observability pipelines, or scripts.
* **Comprehensive Hardware Discovery:** Advanced logic for CPU, RAM, Multi-GPU configurations, Storage (block devices), Mainboard (DMI/SMBIOS), Battery, and OS environments.
* **Zero Bloat:** No Python, no `dbus`. Uses `libcurl` for AI network requests and a single submodule ([cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)) for reliable JSON generation.
* **Memory Safe:** Engineered with an "inside-out" deep-freeing pattern to ensure a zero-leak footprint.

## 🚀 Installation

The project uses Git submodules and requires `libcurl` for AI integrations.

### 1. Install Dependencies
* **Debian / Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install build-essential libcurl4-openssl-dev`
* **Arch Linux:** `sudo pacman -S base-devel curl`
* **Fedora / RHEL:** `sudo dnf install gcc make libcurl-devel`

### 2. Build and Install
Ensure you perform a recursive clone to include all necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/th0truth/hwmonitor.git
cd hwmonitor
make
sudo make install
```
